      learn from.

    <!-- description of next item -->
    <h4>Look at this one:</h4>
    <!-- add appropriate image here (don't forget alt attribute!) -->
    <figure>
      <img
        src="images/kitten.jpg"
        alt="Oops! Your cat is missing!"

    <h2>Sometimes people say important things</h2>
    <!-- description of next section -->
    <p>
      You need to document important things that people say so you can sound
      smart when it's necessary.
    </p>
    <!-- quote -->
    <p>
      Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they
      can't lose. - Bill Gates

    <h2>When it comes to HTML, there are some things you just shouldn't do</h2>
    <!-- description -->
    <p>At least, not anymore...</p>

    <!-- title for next item -->
    <h3><b>Want bold text?</b></h3>
    <!-- make 'right way' bold first the wrong way, then the right way -->
    <p>There's a wrong way and a <b>right way.</b></p>
    <p>Always use the <span id="bold-right-way">right way!</span></p>

    <!-- title for next item -->
    <h3>Maybe you need some italics?</h3>

    <!-- make 'like this' italic using the wrong method. Make 'right way' italic using the correct method -->
    <p>
      Again, it used to be done <i>like this</i>. This is wrong. This is the
      <span id="italic-right-way">right way.</span>
    </p>

    <!-- title for next item -->
    <h3>Separation of concerns</h3>
    <!-- description -->
    <p>
      The wrong way tags above are deprecated and should not be used. HTML
      should be used to mark-up or organize your content. It should not be used
      to style your content or interact with it. Those are the jobs of CSS and
      JavaScript!
    </p>

    <!-- title for next section -->
    <h2>Links</h2>
    <!-- make either 'place' in the next body of text a link to your favorite site. (keep it appropriate) -->
    <p>
      Links are one of the most important parts of the web. They help you
      navigate from <a href="https://samharris.org/">place</a> to
      <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/">place</a> on the internet.
    </p>

    <!-- title for next section -->
    <h2>Sections</h2>
    <!-- go back through and group each section correctly
     stretch: give each group a class that properly reflects what they represent -->
    <p>
      Section elements are good for grouping elements that belong together. You
      can also use div's for this.
