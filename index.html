          <h3>Hi, welcome to the site!</h3>
          <p>
            I develop software and fool around with data analysis. I live in
            Columbus Ohio, and I have a lot of different hobbies. Most of these
            would bore you, so I'll spare you the details. What won't bore you
            (I hope) are my awesome projects, so check 'em out below!

          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>
            I'm an introverted nerd. When I'm not programming I read a lot of
            sci-fi and fantasy, and I annoy my neighbors by playing the piano
            too loudly. Once in a while I leave the house to hike in the woods,
            and sometimes I host board game nights for my fellow nerds. Some day
            I plan to have an active social life, but right now I avoid parties
            and large gatherings like the plague. Fortunately past exposures
            have programmed me to mimic human emotions well enough to masquerade
            as a human being in most settings. My saving grace is that I
            genuinely like humans, and I find myself endlessly curious about
            them.
