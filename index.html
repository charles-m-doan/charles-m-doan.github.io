				<h3>Hi, welcome to my site!</h3>
				<p>
					I live in Columbus Ohio where I develop software and study data
					analytics. When I'm not coding I juggle a long list of hobbies like
					reading and playing piano. Most of these hobbies would bore you. What
					won't bore you (I hope) are my awesome projects, so check 'em out
					below!

				<h3>About Me</h3>
				<h4>Professional Summary</h4>
				<p>
					I'm a former U.S. sailor from the
					<a
						target="_blank"
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_George_H.W._Bush"
						>CVN 77 aircraft carrier</a
					>
					stationed in Norfolk Virginia where I served for approximately 4 years
					as a
					<a
						target="_blank"
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_systems_technician_(United_States_Navy)"
						>Naval IT</a
					>. My period of service included a 9 month deployment to the Persian
					Gulf in
					<a
						target="_blank"
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier_Strike_Group_2#2014_deployment"
						>2014</a
					>
					with Carrier Strike Group 2, and my job as an IT involved a wide range
					of technical troubleshooting and customer service. The "customers"
					were officers, contractors, and fellow enlisted personnel on a ship of
					roughly 7000 people. Naval IT duties are similar to those of a
					civilian IT, but combine areas such as helpdesk tech, sys admin,
					network tech, security analyst, and radio tech. Included are also
					navy-specific work such as ship maintenance, watch standing, and
					training for emergencies and damage control. (Civilian ITs don't learn
					how to extinguish fuel fires.)
				</p>
				<h4>Education</h4>
				<p>
					Prior to the Navy I studied at Muskingum University, earning a B.S. in
					computer science. The curriculum focused on software engineering and
					mathematics. I loved it, and I developed a deep fascination with
					artificial intelligence.
				</p>
				<p>
					Most recently I attended several semesters at The Ohio State
					University studying statistics, chemistry, and biology. My purpose in
					doing so was to get a better sense for the data-analytics side of
					computer science and investigate the field of bioinformatics. I found
					statistics fascinating, and I'm now eager to pursue a career that
					combines software engineering and data science.
				</p>
				<h4>Hobbies / Interests</h4>
				<p>
					I'm a nerd. When I'm not coding I read a lot of sci-fi and fantasy,
					and I annoy my neighbors by playing the piano too loudly. I love
					traveling, computer games, playing tennis, and running outside (most
					days on the
					<a
						target="_blank"
						href="https://www.columbus.gov/recreationandparks/trails/Olentangy-Trail/"
						>Olentangy Trail</a
					>). Sometimes I host board game nights for my fellow nerds and
					sometimes I make
					<a target="_blank" href="./static/images/Jesus_Squirrel.jpg"
						>silly images</a
					>
					in photoshop. Intellectually I have insatiable curiosity. Beyond
					fiction, my typical reading ranges from cosmology, biology, and
					neuroscience to philosophy, politics, and history. My personal hero is
					<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan"
						>Carl Sagan</a
					>, and the most profound book I've read recently is
					<a

						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence:_Paths,_Dangers,_Strategies"
						>Superintelligence</a
					>
					by Nick Bostrom.
